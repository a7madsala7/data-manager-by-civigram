# data-manager-by-civigram
- a simple python program that helps with processing some of the geophysics tools outputs, reform it in a way that makes it easy for the automation process and interacting with other visualizing software.
- it rearranges the data from the csv files out from the geophysics device using numpy and pandas libraries forming a "txt" extension files that will be later used.
- when opening the app it reforms a vbasic script for each different user that automates the surfer plotting afterwards.
- the first input it asks from the user is to upload the surfer file (.srf) to copy the properties for the generated files on the surfer scripter.
- then asks the user for the different parameters of the files at first then upload the csv files that is required.
- after this step your files have been added to a new data wind then you will choose the files you want to apply the surfer plotting and click on start surfer.
- when finished click save and the app will ask you for address to save the files at your selected folder.
- the program has another feature linked with the autocad app that helps assigning the depth of the points but you have to choose each file from the data window separately.
- once you have chosen  the file with the desired line you click on autocad button then it gets the information about the points on the line then process the data mixed from the cad and the csv and gets the points output ready for other usage.
**notice that**
    this app works for windows devices only
    this is the first version of the program and expected to have more changes and editions
  i hope this can help anyone and thanks
